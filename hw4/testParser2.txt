{ Two households, both alike in dignit 
y, In fair Verona, where we lay our sc 
ene, From ancient grudge break to new  
mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil  
hands unclean. From forth the fatal lo 
ins of these two foes A pair of star-c 
ross'd lovers take their life; Whose m 
isadventured piteous overthrows Do wit 
h their death bury their parents' stri 
fe. The fearful passage of their death 
-mark'd love, And the continuance of t 
heir parents' rage, Which, but their c 
hildren's end, nought could remove, Is 
 now the two hours' traffic of our sta 
ge; The which if you with patient ears 
 attend, What here shall miss, our toi 
l shall strive to mend. }
